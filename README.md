# covidAppFinal
A Website for Latest COVID-19 Information By State and County 



Overview: 

Our app was designed for the user to find information on local info on COVID-19 stats and information on county health services. The user is also able to view a regularly updated graph showing the current amount of COVID-19 tests given in the U.S, search for COVID-19 related news headlines for a specific country, and use an interactive map displaying infection rates across the entire planet.

COVID-19 Map 

COVID-19 (2019-nCOV / SARS-CoV-2) Coronavirus Map https://ecstatic-noether-5ea480.netlify.app/) is an interactive, animated map for the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak.
The Mapping application uses an API containing recent Coronavirus statistics and maps out the locations and impact each country is facing.
On the map, it shows a marker for each country with the number of confirmed cases. On top of that, it includes a little popup tooltip that shows more in depth information.
